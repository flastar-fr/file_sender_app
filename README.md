# App to send a file from a computer to another computer

To work this program needs a file ``datas.json`` located in ``/file_send_app/`` directory.

This file is automatically created if it doesn't exist. If for any reason it didn't, you can follow and create yourself 
with this structure

```
{
  "ip": {"PC 1": "IP1", 
  "PC 2":  "IP2", 
  etc...}
}
```
You can chose the name which will be displayed when chosing the computer.

You need to put a device that is not the one you use actually.
