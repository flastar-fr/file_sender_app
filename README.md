# App to send a file from a computer to another computer

To work this program needs a file ``datas.json`` located in ``/file_send/app/`` directory.

For obvious reasons the file ``datas.json`` is not shared in this project but it looks like :
```
{
  "ip": {"PC 1": "IP1", 
  "PC 2":  "IP2", 
  etc...}
}
```
You can chose the name which will be displayed when chosing the computer.

You need to put a device that is not the one you use actually.
